###Project: Multiple Linear Regression Model of Sarracenia Biomass

The following uses data from EDI Data Portal (<https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-hfr.109.18>) and uses multiple linear regression model to answer the question: how do morphological, physiological, and/or taxonomic Sarracenia characteristics predict biomass? 

### Files Overview

The two main folders are data and code. The "data" folder contains the file knb-lter-hfr.109.18 which is used for the analysis. The "code" folder contains final_homework_draft.qmd where the code for the models are stored. 

### Methods and Results

The data was briefly investigated for missing data, homoscedasticity, and normality (assumptions for linear regression). Then, multiple models were created and tested for best fit to see if Sarracenia characteristics were a good predictor of plant biomass.
