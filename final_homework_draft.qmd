# Introduction

a\. What are Sarracenia?

b\. Why might people care about them?

c\. Why do you think it could be useful and/or important to predict individual biomass from morphological, physiological, or taxonomic characteristics?

d\. What questions are you addressing?

How do Sarracenia characteristics predict biomass?

e\. What hypothesis are you testing?

Null hypothesis is that a multiple linear regression does not predict Sarracenia biomass. Alternative hypothesis is that at least one variable will predict Sarracenia biomass.

f\. Include 3-5 in-text citations of peer-reviewed work.
